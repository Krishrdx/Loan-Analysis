# Loan Analysis Project – Documentation

## Overview
End-to-end Loan Analysis project: cleaned & modeled loan data, implemented SQL pre-processing, built Power BI ETL in Power Query, created an organized Measures table with DAX measures, validated results with SQL & Excel pivot tables, and produced interactive dashboards. Demonstrates analytics skills transferable to supply chain analytics.

## Steps
1. **Data Extraction (SQL)** – filtered nulls, removed invalids, staged clean table.
2. **Data Cleaning (Power Query)** – type correction, text cleaning, duplicates removal, Year/Month derivation.
3. **Modeling (Power BI)** – Measures table, Calendar, relationships.
4. **DAX Measures** – Loan Amount, Default Rate %, YOY changes, Avg Income.
5. **Validation** – SQL row counts, null checks, sums, Excel pivots.
6. **Dashboards** – Loan Default Overview, Applicant Demographics, Financial Risk Metrics.
7. **Supply Chain Relevance** – Defaults ≈ order failures; Loan amount ≈ volumes; Profiles ≈ suppliers/customers.
